The Three Foundational Math Subjects for Getting Started with AI: Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability

AI is gradually transforming our lives, and to truly understand the technology behind it, a solid foundation in mathematics is indispensable. Whether you're aiming to work as an engineer in the AI field or contribute to the AI community meaningfully, math will be a key to your success. Today, we'll explore three essential mathematical disciplines—Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability—and how they can help you build a strong foundation for deeper exploration in AI.

When I first began studying how ChatGPT works, I hoped to bypass the math. But soon I realized—there’s no way around it. I also came to understand a deeper truth: there’s no shortcut to mastering anything worth learning. Thankfully, resources like 3Blue1Brown make learning Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability much more intuitive and visual.

Why Is Math So Important for AI?
In traditional software development, programmers often rely on well-packaged libraries to build applications, focusing on business logic and user interfaces. However, AI development is fundamentally different. At its core, AI relies heavily on mathematics—especially Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability. These mathematical tools are the backbone of machine learning and deep learning. Understanding them not only empowers you to use AI tools but also equips you to optimize and innovate upon them.

The Three Core Math Subjects
1. Linear Algebra
Vectors, matrices, and tensors are the fundamental data structures in neural networks.

Both forward propagation and backpropagation in neural networks rely on matrix operations.

Studying linear algebra helps you understand how information flows through layers of a neural network and how models are optimized.

2. Calculus
Backpropagation, the training algorithm for neural networks, is fundamentally based on calculus, especially the chain rule.

Gradient descent—the most commonly used optimization algorithm—requires derivatives to update model parameters.

Calculus helps you understand how to minimize loss functions and improve model performance.

3. Probability
Many AI models, especially in Natural Language Processing (like GPT), are grounded in probability.

Concepts such as Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimation provide a theoretical basis for generation and prediction tasks.

Probability allows you to understand the model’s predicted probability distributions and use them to make better decisions.

Why Start with These Three?
To make real progress in AI, mastering these three core math subjects is crucial. Many beginners try to avoid math, thinking they can get by without it. But the reality is that AI research and application require math to translate theory and algorithms into executable code.

Without a solid mathematical understanding, it's hard to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability form the mathematical core of AI algorithms. Without these tools, you’ll struggle to fine-tune and improve your models effectively.

Learning Path
Phase 1: Linear Algebra
Start with the fundamentals—vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. These concepts are at the heart of deep learning.

Phase 2: Calculus
Next, move on to calculus with a focus on derivatives, the chain rule, and gradient descent—all key to optimization algorithms.

Phase 3: Probability
Finally, study probability theory. Learn about conditional probability, Bayesian inference, and probability distributions to understand model reasoning and optimization.

Recommended Study Order
For most AI learners, the recommended sequence is:

Linear Algebra

Calculus

Probability

After mastering these, you can move on to advanced topics like Information Theory, Optimization, and Discrete Mathematics.

Understanding vs. Using
In AI, you're not just using tools—you’re learning how they work. This marks a major shift from traditional software development, where libraries hide the complexity. In AI, deep mathematical understanding is essential. By learning these three subjects, you'll gain insights into the internal workings of neural networks and build a theoretical foundation for model tuning and innovation.

Conclusion
By systematically studying Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability, you'll lay a strong foundation for your future in AI. This will not only help you grasp the core technologies but also build your credibility within the AI community. Once you've mastered these subjects, you can continue learning advanced topics like Information Theory and Optimization Algorithms, and gradually become an expert in the field.
